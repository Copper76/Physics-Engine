# Physics Engine

Physics engine made using the tutorials of [Game Physics In One Weekend book series](https://gamephysicsweekend.github.io/). The renderer came with the book while the code for the engine is hand-coded by me.

## Controls

The controls for the renderer are very basic.

```
Mouse look to rotate the camera around the origin.
Scroll to zoom.
"R" to reset the scene.
"T" to pause and unpause time.
"Y" to step the simulation by a single frame (only works when the simulation is paused).
```
